My project intends to predict the survivability of the passenger in the car depending on various conditions and situations internal to the car and seating of the passenger. The dataset that has been used for making predictions has been obtained by events recorded by the police throughout the USA. To make predictions, it was important to know the nature of the predictor variables and the nature of response variable for making the predictions. Testing the dataset with various techniques for highest accuracy was carried out to select the optimum model for the dataset and implementing the resampling techniques to further better the accuracy was carried out for the dataset.


The dataset has predictor variables which covers majority of factors revolving around an accident scene. These variables are provided in detail and to the point. As a matter of service to society this dataset can be analyzed to find out the chances of survival of a victim when he is bought in emergency to hospital and by knowing some key factors about the accident scene the doctors can be forewarned about the chances of survivability of the victim. The raw dataset can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/master/csv/DAAG/nassCDS.csv.
